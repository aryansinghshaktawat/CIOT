# Sherlock & Social Analyzer Integration Fixes

## Summary
This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve issues with Sherlock project and Social Analyzer integration in the CIOT Toolkit.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Sherlock Installation Issues
**Problem**: Sherlock installation was failing with "no such file or directory 'pip'" error.

**Root Cause**: The installer was using `pipx` first, which might not be available, and the pip command might not be in PATH.

**Solution Applied**:
- Modified `_install_sherlock_async()` method to use `python -m pip install sherlock-project` first
- Added fallback to `pipx install sherlock-project` if pip fails
- Improved error handling and timeout management (300 seconds)
- Added better status feedback during installation

### 2. Social Analyzer CLI Integration
**Problem**: Social Analyzer was only available via Docker, limiting functionality and causing output parsing issues.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added dual-engine support: Docker container + Local CLI
- Implemented `_install_social_analyzer_cli()` method for pip-based installation
- Enhanced CLI command construction with proper parameter handling
- Improved JSON output parsing with brace balance tracking
- Added metadata mode support for both engines

### 3. Missing Method Errors
**Problem**: Application was crashing with AttributeError for missing `_pull_sherlock_image` method.

**Solution Applied**:
- Implemented `_pull_sherlock_image()` method for Docker image management
- Added proper error handling for Docker operations
- Integrated with engine selector for seamless Docker/CLI switching

### 4. Google Dorking Robot Detection
**Problem**: Rapid tab opening was triggering "I'm not a robot" challenges.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added configurable `GOOGLE_DORK_OPEN_DELAY` attribute (1 second default)
- Applied delays to all Google dorking functions in `surface_web_tab.py`
- Prevents bot detection while maintaining usability

### 5. Traceroute DNS Resolution Issues
**Problem**: Traceroute was failing with "unknown host" errors for valid domains.

**Solution Applied**:
- Enhanced `_run_traceroute()` with DNS resolution first
- Added fallback mechanisms: traceroute → mtr → ping TTL simulation
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Structured output formatting

## Technical Improvements

### Code Quality
- Fixed all syntax errors and indentation issues
- Improved error handling throughout the codebase
- Enhanced user feedback with detailed status messages
- Added proper threading for non-blocking operations

### Installation Reliability
- **Sherlock**: `python -m pip install sherlock-project` → fallback to `pipx install sherlock-project`
- **Social Analyzer**: `pip install social-analyzer` for local CLI
- Proper command availability checking with `shutil.which()`
- Timeout protection (300 seconds) for long installations

### Engine Flexibility
- **Sherlock**: Docker container + Local CLI modes
- **Social Analyzer**: Docker container + Local CLI modes
- Unified interface for both engines
- Automatic fallback when tools are missing

### Output Processing
- Enhanced JSON parsing for Social Analyzer results
- Brace balance tracking for reliable JSON extraction
- Structured export formats (TXT, CSV, JSON)
- Real-time output streaming for better user experience

## Verification Steps

All fixes have been tested and verified:

1. ✅ Module imports successfully without syntax errors
2. ✅ Sherlock installer uses python -m pip first, then pipx fallback
3. ✅ Social Analyzer supports both Docker and CLI engines
4. ✅ Missing method errors resolved
5. ✅ Google dorking includes anti-bot delays
6. ✅ Traceroute includes DNS resolution and fallbacks

## Usage Instructions

### Sherlock Profile Scraper
1. Select engine: "Docker" or "Local CLI"
2. Enter target username
3. Click "Auto Install & Scan" for automatic setup
4. Export results in TXT, CSV, or JSON format

### Social Analyzer
1. Choose engine: "Docker" or "Local CLI"  
2. Select mode: "Normal", "Metadata", or "Web GUI"
3. Enter target username
4. Enable metadata checkbox if needed
5. Click "Install CLI" for local setup or "Run Analysis"

### Network Tools
- Traceroute automatically resolves DNS and uses best available tool
- Google dorking includes 1-second delays between tabs

## Files Modified

1. `src/gui/tabs/additional_tools_tab.py` - Main integration fixes
2. `src/gui/tabs/surface_web_tab.py` - Google dorking delays
3. Various imports and dependencies updated

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

All Sherlock and Social Analyzer issues have been addressed. The toolkit is now in a stable, working state with reliable installation, dual-engine support, and proper error handling.
