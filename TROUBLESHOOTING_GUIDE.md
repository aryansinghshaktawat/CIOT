2. **Check Network Connection**
   - Ensure stable internet connection
   - Try investigation at different times
   - Check if firewall is blocking API calls

3. **Review Privacy Considerations**
   - Some numbers have enhanced privacy settings
   - Business numbers may have more public information
   - Consider legal and ethical limitations

4. **Try Alternative Methods**
   - Use different investigation types (email, name)
   - Cross-reference with other OSINT tools
   - Manual verification through public directories

#### Issue: Country selection problems

**Symptoms:**
- Desired country not in dropdown list
- Parsing fails even with correct format
- Country-specific features not working

**Solutions:**
1. **Use Auto-Detect Mode**
   - Select "Auto-Detect" from country dropdown
   - Include full international format with country code

2. **Try Similar Countries**
   - Use neighboring countries with similar formats
   - Check if the number format matches available countries

3. **Manual Format Adjustment**
   - Research the correct international format
   - Use online phone number format guides
   - Include country code explicitly

### üñºÔ∏è Image Analysis Issues

#### Issue: "Image upload failed" or "Analysis failed"

**Solutions:**

   - Avoid corrupted or unusual formats

2. **File Size Limits**
   - Keep images under 10MB
   - Compress large images if necessary

3. **Network Issues**
   - Check internet connection for reverse search
   - Try uploading smaller images first

#### Issue: "No reverse search results"

**Solutions:**
1. **Image Quality**
   - Use high-quality, clear images
   - Avoid heavily edited or filtered images

2. **Try Different Search Engines**
   - Results vary between Google, Yandex, TinEye
   - Some engines work better for specific image types

### üïµÔ∏è Dark Web Investigation Issues

#### Issue: ".onion URL not accessible"

**Solutions:**
1. **Tor Browser Required**
   - Install Tor browser for .onion access
   - Ensure Tor is running properly

2. **Service Availability**
   - .onion services may be temporarily down
   - Try accessing at different times

3. **URL Verification**
   - Double-check .onion URL spelling
   - Ensure URL is still active

### ü§ñ AI Assistant Issues

#### Issue: "No AI response" or "Service unavailable"

**Solutions:**
1. **Try Different Service Types**

   - Each service has different capabilities

2. **Check Question Format**
   - Use clear, specific questions
   - Avoid overly complex or ambiguous queries

3. **Network Connectivity**
   - Ensure internet connection for online services
   - Offline Analysis works without internet

### üõ†Ô∏è Additional Tools Issues

#### Issue: Port scanner or DNS lookup fails

**Solutions:**
1. **Target Accessibility**
   - Ensure target host is online and accessible
   - Check if target blocks scanning attempts

2. **Network Configuration**
   - Check firewall settings
   - Ensure network allows outbound connections

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Wait between scans to avoid rate limits
   - Use different targets for testing

### üÜî Aadhaar Validator Issues

#### Issue: "Invalid Aadhaar number" for valid numbers

**Solutions:**
1. **Format Check**
   - Use 12-digit format: 1234 5678 9012
   - Remove spaces and special characters if needed

2. **Validation Algorithm**
   - System uses official Verhoeff algorithm
   - Some test numbers may not pass validation

## General Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Basic Diagnostics

**Check System Requirements:**
- Python 3.8+ installed
- All dependencies from requirements.txt
- Stable internet connection
- Sufficient disk space

**Restart Application:**
```bash
# Close application completely
# Restart with:
python ciot.py
```

### 2. Clear Cache and Temporary Files

**Clear Browser Cache:**

- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Restart browser

**Clear Application Cache:**
```bash
# Remove temporary files (if any)
rm -rf temp/
rm -rf cache/
```

### 3. Check Logs

**Application Logs:**
- Check `logs/` directory for error messages
- Look for recent timestamps matching your issue
- Note any API errors or connection failures

**Error Message Analysis:**
- Copy exact error messages
- Note when the error occurs
- Document steps to reproduce

### 4. Network Diagnostics

**Test Internet Connection:**
```bash
# Test basic connectivity
ping google.com

# Test DNS resolution
nslookup google.com
```

**Check API Accessibility:**
- Try accessing API endpoints manually
- Check if corporate firewall blocks requests
- Test from different network if possible

### 5. Update and Reinstall

**Update Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

**Reinstall Application:**
```bash
# Backup your data first
cp -r data/ data_backup/

# Reinstall
git pull origin main
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
