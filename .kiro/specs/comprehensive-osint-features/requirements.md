## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) toolkit with four main functional areas: Surface Web OSINT, Dark Web OSINT, AI Assistant, and Additional Tools. The application should provide professional-grade investigation capabilities for cybersecurity professionals, law enforcement, private investigators, journalists, and corporate security teams while maintaining ethical and legal compliance standards.

## Requirements

4. WHEN a user selects "IP Address" lookup type THEN the system SHALL provide geolocation, ISP information, threat intelligence, and network analysis
5. WHEN a user enters a target and clicks search THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive OSINT links and display findings in a large results textbox
6. WHEN investigation results are available THEN the system SHALL provide PDF export functionality for professional reporting
7. WHEN performing any lookup THEN the system SHALL validate input format and provide appropriate error messages for invalid inputs

### Requirement 2: Dark Web OSINT Tab

**User Story:** As a cybersecurity professional, I want to investigate dark web activities using specialized tools (TorBot, h8mail, OnionScan, etc.), so that I can gather threat intelligence and investigate criminal activities while maintaining operational security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects "TorBot" tool THEN the system SHALL provide .onion URL crawling with options for saving results, extracting emails, and checking live status
2. WHEN a user selects "h8mail" tool THEN the system SHALL provide email breach hunting with options for chasing related emails, using local breaches, and hiding passwords
3. WHEN a user selects "OnionScan" tool THEN the system SHALL provide security analysis of .onion sites with verbose output and fingerprint analysis options
4. WHEN a user selects "Final Recon" tool THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive web reconnaissance with modules for headers, SSL analysis, WHOIS, and site crawling
5. WHEN a user selects "Bitcoin Analysis" tool THEN the system SHALL provide cryptocurrency investigation with transaction history and clustering analysis
6. WHEN any dark web tool is executed THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress updates and comprehensive results display
7. WHEN results are available THEN the system SHALL provide export functionality in both PDF and JSON formats
8. WHEN using Tor-dependent tools THEN the system SHALL provide Tor service management and status checking

### Requirement 3: AI Assistant Tab

**User Story:** As an investigator, I want an intelligent OSINT assistant that provides methodology guidance, tool recommendations, and analysis help, so that I can improve my investigation techniques and make informed decisions about tool selection and best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects "Free AI Chat" service THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent responses for OSINT-related questions using rule-based analysis
2. WHEN a user selects "Offline Analysis" service THEN the system SHALL provide local keyword analysis, pattern recognition, and topic detection
3. WHEN a user selects "Web Search" service THEN the system SHALL generate optimized search queries and provide relevant resource recommendations
4. WHEN a user asks about email investigation THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive methodology including validation, breach checking, and OSINT techniques
5. WHEN a user asks about phone investigation THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on carrier lookup, reverse search, and associated account discovery
6. WHEN a user asks about cryptocurrency investigation THEN the system SHALL provide blockchain analysis methodology and tool recommendations
7. WHEN providing any guidance THEN the system SHALL include legal and ethical considerations and compliance reminders

### Requirement 4: Additional Tools Tab

**User Story:** As a security professional, I want access to specialized network, social media, and cryptocurrency analysis tools organized by category, so that I can perform comprehensive technical investigations and gather intelligence across multiple domains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses Network Tools THEN the system SHALL provide functional port scanner, DNS lookup, and traceroute capabilities
2. WHEN a user runs port scanner THEN the system SHALL scan common ports, identify services, provide security assessment, and display results with progress indicators
3. WHEN a user runs DNS lookup THEN the system SHALL resolve domains, perform reverse DNS, and provide links to advanced DNS analysis tools
4. WHEN a user runs traceroute THEN the system SHALL execute real-time network path tracing with hop-by-hop analysis and provide alternative online tools
5. WHEN a user accesses Social Media Tools THEN the system SHALL provide username search across platforms, social analyzer integration, and profile scraper tools
6. WHEN a user runs username search THEN the system SHALL check availability across 12+ major platforms and open results in browser tabs
7. WHEN a user accesses Crypto Tools THEN the system SHALL provide blockchain explorer integration, wallet analyzer, and transaction tracker with real-time API integration
8. WHEN using any tool THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive results display, professional documentation, and relevant resource links

### Requirement 5: Professional Reporting and Export

**User Story:** As an investigator, I want to generate professional reports from my OSINT investigations, so that I can document findings for legal proceedings, client deliverables, or organizational reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN investigation results are available THEN the system SHALL provide PDF export with proper formatting and professional layout
2. WHEN exporting results THEN the system SHALL include investigation metadata (timestamp, tool used, target, methodology)
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL handle special characters and long content appropriately
4. WHEN exporting dark web results THEN the system SHALL provide both PDF and JSON format options
5. WHEN creating any report THEN the system SHALL include legal disclaimers and methodology documentation

### Requirement 6: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive and professional interface that provides clear navigation, helpful guidance, and comprehensive information about each tool's capabilities, so that I can efficiently conduct investigations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing any tab THEN the system SHALL provide an information button with comprehensive tool descriptions and usage guidance
