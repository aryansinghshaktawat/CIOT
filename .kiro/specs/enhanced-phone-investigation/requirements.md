# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for enhancing the phone number investigation feature in the OSINT toolkit to accept multiple input formats and provide comprehensive phone number analysis using Google's libphonenumber library. The enhancement will improve user experience by automatically handling various phone number formats and providing more accurate parsing based on country selection.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multiple Input Format Support

**User Story:** As an investigator, I want to input phone numbers in any common format (local, international, formatted, unformatted), so that I don't need to manually format numbers before investigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a phone number in local format (e.g., 9876543210) THEN the system SHALL automatically parse and format it correctly
2. WHEN a user enters a phone number with country code (e.g., +91 9876543210) THEN the system SHALL recognize and process the international format
3. WHEN a user enters a phone number with leading zero (e.g., 09876543210) THEN the system SHALL handle the format appropriately for the selected country
4. WHEN a user enters a formatted phone number with spaces, brackets, or dashes (e.g., (+91) 98765-43210) THEN the system SHALL extract and process the digits correctly
5. WHEN a user enters an invalid phone number format THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with format examples
6. WHEN multiple parsing attempts are made THEN the system SHALL use the first successful validation result

### Requirement 2: Country-Based Phone Number Parsing

**User Story:** As an investigator, I want to select the country context for phone number analysis, so that I can get more accurate parsing and validation results for numbers from different regions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects "Phone Number" lookup type THEN the system SHALL display a country selection dropdown
2. WHEN a user selects a country from the dropdown THEN the system SHALL update the input placeholder with country-specific format examples
3. WHEN a user selects "India (IN)" THEN the system SHALL provide examples like "9876543210, +91 9876543210"
4. WHEN a user selects "United States (US)" THEN the system SHALL provide examples like "(555) 123-4567, +1 555 123 4567"
5. WHEN a user selects "Auto-Detect (Global)" THEN the system SHALL attempt to parse the number without country context
6. WHEN parsing a phone number THEN the system SHALL use the selected country as the default context for libphonenumber parsing
7. WHEN no country is selected THEN the system SHALL default to India (IN) for backward compatibility

### Requirement 3: Google libphonenumber Integration
